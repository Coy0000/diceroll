# Dice Roll Game

Welcome to the **Dice Roll Game**! This is a basic dice rolling simulator built with Python.

This project was built to practice working with:
- Python's `random` module.
- Terminal-based user input/output.
- Basic loops and control flow.



## Features

- Roll a virtual dice and see the result in Unicode dice faces.
- Option to keep rolling or exit the game.
